# POWER-BI-PROJECT
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of financial data, featuring various visuals that offer insights into sales performance. The visuals include a pie chart showing sales distribution by product, a globe chart displaying sales by country, and card charts highlighting total sales and gross sales. Additionally, a clustered chart illustrates sales by country and product, while a line chart reveals the monthly sales trend. Further analysis is provided through a stacked column chart showing units sold by segment and country, a doughnut chart illustrating discount brand contribution to gross sales, and a clustered column chart examining profit margin analysis by product. Other visuals include a matrix for geographic and segment sales overview, a line chart for gross sales time series analysis, a waterfall chart for segment-wise profit contribution, and a treemap showing sales breakdown by discount band. The dashboard also features charts comparing yearly profit by country, overall units sold, sales distribution across products and segments, and day-by-day COGS and sales comparison.
